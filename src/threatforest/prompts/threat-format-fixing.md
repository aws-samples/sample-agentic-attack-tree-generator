You are a cybersecurity expert. I have a threat model document that contains threat information but not in the correct format.

Please reformat ALL threats in this document to use this EXACT format structure:

# Generated Threat Statements - [Application Name]

*This file was automatically generated by ThreatForest AI analysis.*

## Application Context
- **Application**: [Application Name]
- **Generated**: [Current timestamp]
- **Total Threats**: [Number]
- **High Priority**: [Number]
- **Medium Priority**: [Number]
- **Low Priority**: [Number]

## Threat Statements

### High Priority Threats

#### T001 - [Descriptive Category Name]

**Threat Statement**: A [threat source] with [prerequisites], can [threat action], which leads to [threat impact], resulting in [reduced goal] of [impacted assets].

- **Threat Source**: [threat source]
- **Prerequisites**: [prerequisites]
- **Threat Action**: [threat action]
- **Threat Impact**: [threat impact]
- **Reduced Goal**: [reduced goal]
- **Impacted Assets**: [impacted assets]
- **Priority**: High
- **Category**: [Descriptive Category Name]

---

#### T002 - [Next Category Name]

[Same format for next threat]

### Medium Priority Threats

#### T00X - [Category Name]

[Same format for Medium priority threats with sequential T numbers]

### Low Priority Threats

#### T00Y - [Category Name]

[Same format for Low priority threats with sequential T numbers]

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use SEQUENTIAL T001, T002, T003... identifiers (NOT UUIDs or original IDs)
2. Use descriptive category names (e.g., "Data Breach", "Authentication", "Injection Attack") NOT generic ones
3. Ensure threat statements follow the exact syntax: "A [source] with [prerequisites], can [action], which leads to [impact], resulting in [reduced goal] of [assets]"
4. Group threats by priority (High, Medium, Low)
5. Include all structured fields for each threat
6. Use consistent markdown formatting with --- separators

Return a complete markdown document with properly formatted threat statements using sequential T001, T002, etc. identifiers.
