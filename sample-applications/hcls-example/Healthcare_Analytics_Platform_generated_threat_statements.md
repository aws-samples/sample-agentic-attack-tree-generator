## Usage Notes

These threat statements were generated using AI analysis of your application context. They follow the standard threat modeling syntax:

**"A [threat source] with [pre-requisites], can [threat action], which leads to [threat impact], resulting in [reduced goal] of [impacted assets]."**

### Next Steps
1. Review and validate these threat statements
2. Modify or add threats as needed for your specific context
3. Use these threats as input for attack tree generation
4. Consider implementing mitigations for high-priority threats

### Customization
You can edit this file to:
- Add more specific threat statements
- Adjust priority levels
- Include additional context or mitigations
- Remove threats that don't apply to your application
