 End users interact with the data and insights across all the normalized healthcare data through a number of ways. For example:

Business users and regulators perform analysis, view dashboards, and receive reports using business intelligence tools like QuickSight.

Custom application integrations use the data to surface insights to end users, including to the point of care. Data can be accessed using a variety of AWS services such as Lambda functions, containers running in Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, or AWS AppSync. Verify that the AWS services being used are eligible for the healthcare compliance framework applicable to your workload (such as the HIPAA Eligible AWS Services).

Machine learning (ML) experts can pull standardized datasets and combine them with datasets using custom data preparation processes.
